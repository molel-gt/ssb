# Laminate Cell Model
In this work, we conceive a laminate cell where the active material and the solid electrolyte are connected along the transport axis and thus are not tortuous. At this, stage, we are exploring whether the laminate model might be less computationally intensive and thus is tractable with direct numerical simulations. A less computationally-intensive direct numerical simulation might paint a clearer picture than pseudo-two-dimensional models paired with effective properties.

## Background and Motivation
There are various fabrication routes for experimental solid-state batteries including dry-pressing and slurry coating. Let us highlight dry-pressing. Active material particles are milled and mixed with milled solid electrolyte. Processing binder and conductive additives are then added to improve electrical and mechanical properties. Ideally, we hope that the active material particles get connected along the transport axis from the current collector to the electrode/separator interface.
